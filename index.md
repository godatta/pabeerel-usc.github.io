Peter Beerel received his B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 1989, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1991 and 1994, respectively. He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems at the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering in 1994, where he is currently a Full Professor. Dr. Beerel was the Faculty Director of Innovation Studies at the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation from 2006 to 2008. In May of 2008, he took a leave of absence from USC and co-founded TimeLess Design Automation with one of his Ph.D. students, Dr. Georgios Dimou. Their mission was to demonstrate and commercialize an asynchronous ASIC flow for high-performance systems. They were successful and sold the company in July of 2010 to Fulcrum Microsystems which was acquired by Intel in 2011. In 2015, his Ph.D. student, Dylan Hand, co-founded a second company, Reduced Energy Microsystems, to commercialize an asynchronous ASIC flow for ultra-low-power vision and machine learning systems. Dr. Beerel joined REM as Chief Scientist in 2016.
